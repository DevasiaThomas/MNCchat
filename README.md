# MNCchat
This a simple client server chat application written in C. Which was required as a submission in CSE-589 at UB. You can find the problem description in its respective file.

To prevent plaigarism I have introduced many bugs, and as such this program will not get you any points if you use it for the same course at UB. I had planned to put comments at the places I did so... but meh... ( As a hint i removed many '!' and have used free() incorrectly---> this is not all :) ).

Enjoy.
